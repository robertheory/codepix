# CodePix

## Overview

The **CodePix** project is a _conceptual_ application developed to simulate instant financial transactions using the Pix payment system. This project is not a real published application but serves as a case study to explore and test the efficiency and security of various technologies in a high-demand scenario.

## Purpose

The main objective of CodePix is to demonstrate the use of modern technologies to simulate a critical environment of instant banking transactions. The technologies involved include:

- **GRPC**: Used for efficient communication between services.
- **REST**: Implemented to expose APIs in a simple and accessible manner.
- **Messaging**: Used to ensure asynchronous message delivery and processing.
- **Database**: For secure and efficient storage of transactions.

## Features

CodePix includes the following features:

- Simulation of Pix transactions.
- Communication between services using GRPC.
- Exposure of REST APIs for system interaction.
- Asynchronous message processing.
- Secure storage of transactions in a database.

## Concepts Involved

During the development of CodePix, several important concepts are explored, such as:

- **Parallelism**: Simultaneous execution of multiple operations to increase efficiency.
- **Race Conditions**: Conditions that can occur in concurrent environments and how to avoid them.
- **Scalability**: The system's ability to handle an increase in workload.
- **Security**: Protection of data and transactions against unauthorized access.

CodePix is an excellent opportunity to study and understand how these technologies and concepts can be applied in a high-demand environment, such as instant financial transactions.
